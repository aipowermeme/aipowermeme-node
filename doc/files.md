## Data directory location

The data directory is the default location where the AIPowerMeme Core files are stored.

1. The default data directory paths for supported platforms are:

Platform | Data directory path
---------|--------------------
Linux    | `$HOME/.aipowermeme/`
macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/AIPowerMemecore/`
Windows  | `%APPDATA%\AIPowerMemecore\` <sup>[\[1\]](#note1)</sup>

2. The non-default data directory path can be specified by `-datadir` option.

3. All content of the data directory, except for `aipowermeme.conf` file, is chain-specific. This means the actual data directory paths for non-mainnet cases differ:

Chain option        | Data directory path
--------------------|--------------------
no option (mainnet) | *path_to_datadir*`/`
`-testnet`          | *path_to_datadir*`/testnet3/`
`-regtest`          | *path_to_datadir*`/regtest/`

## Data directory layout

Subdirectory       | File(s)               | Description

## Multi-wallet environment

Wallets are Berkeley DB (BDB) or SQLite databases.

1. Each user-defined wallet named "wallet_name" resides in the `wallets/wallet_name/` subdirectory.

2. The default (unnamed) wallet resides in `wallets/` subdirectory; if the latter does not exist, the wallet resides in the data directory.

3. A wallet database path can be specified with the `-wallet` option.

4. `wallet.dat` files must not be shared across different node instances, as that can result in key-reuse and double-spends due the lack of synchronization between instances.

5. Any copy or backup of the wallet should be done through a `backupwallet` call in order to update and lock the wallet, preventing any file corruption caused by updates during the copy.


### Berkeley DB database based wallets

Subdirectory | File(s)           | Description
-------------|-------------------|-------------
`database/`  | BDB logging files | Part of BDB environment; created at start and deleted on shutdown; a user *must keep it as safe* as personal wallet `wallet.dat`
`./`         | `db.log`          | BDB error file
`./`         | `wallet.dat`      | Personal wallet (a BDB database) with keys and transactions
`./`         | `.walletlock`     | BDB wallet lock file

### SQLite database based wallets

Subdirectory | File                 | Description
-------------|----------------------|-------------
`./`         | `wallet.dat`         | Personal wallet (a SQLite database) with keys and transactions
`./`         | `wallet.dat-journal` | SQLite Rollback Journal file for `wallet.dat`. Usually created at start and deleted on shutdown. A user *must keep it as safe* as the `wallet.dat` file.


## GUI settings

`aipowermeme-qt` uses [`QSettings`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html) class; this implies platform-specific [locations where application settings are stored](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html#locations-where-application-settings-are-stored).

## Legacy subdirectories and files

These subdirectories and files are no longer used by AIPowerMeme Core:
