Coinbase Changes
------------------------

Once the `mn_rr` hard fork activates, some coinbase funds will be moved into the Credit Pool balance (to Platform). Evonodes will then receive a single reward per payment cycle on the Core chain - not quad rewards (4 sequential blocks) as in v19/v20. The remainder of evonode payments will be distributed by Platform from the asset lock pool. This is to incentivize evonodes to upgrade to platform, because only nodes running platform will get these migrated rewards.
