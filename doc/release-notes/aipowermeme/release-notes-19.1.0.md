# AIPowerMeme Core version v19.1.0

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.aipowermeme.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new minor version release, bringing various bugfixes and other improvements.

This release is mandatory for all nodes. This release delays v19 hard fork activation and
will effectively hard fork the network. v19.0.0 nodes must upgrade to continue syncing properly.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/AIPowerMeme-Qt (on Mac) or
aipowermemed/aipowermeme-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

When upgrading from a version prior to 18.0.1, the
first startup of AIPowerMeme Core will run a migration process which can take anywhere
from a few minutes to thirty minutes to finish. After the migration, a
downgrade to an older version is only possible with a reindex
(or reindex-chainstate).

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v19.1.0
Downgrading below v19.1.0 is not supported as v19.0.0 will attempt to hard fork, however this hardfork is problematic
and is being delayed with this version

### Downgrade to a version < v19.0.0
Downgrading to a version older than v19.0.0 is not supported due to changes in the evodb database. If you need to use an older version, you must either reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

# Notable changes

## Delaying v19 Hard Fork

The start date for the v19 Hard Fork has been delayed until June 14th. The earliest hard fork date will be roughly two
weeks after that date. A new version will be required before this date to ensure a smooth hard fork.
