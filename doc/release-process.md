Release Process
====================

* Update translations, see [translation_process.md](https://github.com/aipowermeme/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md#synchronising-translations).

* Update manpages, see [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/aipowermeme/blob/master/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagessh).
* Update release candidate version in `configure.ac` (`CLIENT_VERSION_RC`)

Before every minor and major release:

* Update [bips.md](bips.md) to account for changes since the last release.
* Update version in `configure.ac` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`) (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_RC` to `0`)
* Write release notes (see below)
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` nMinimumChainWork with information from the getblockchaininfo rpc.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` defaultAssumeValid with information from the getblockhash rpc.
  - The selected value must not be orphaned so it may be useful to set the value two blocks back from the tip.
  - Testnet should be set some tens of thousands back from the tip due to reorgs there.
  - This update should be reviewed with a reindex-chainstate with assumevalid=0 to catch any defect
     that causes rejection of blocks in the past history.

Before every major release:

* Update hardcoded [seeds](/contrib/seeds/README.md). TODO: Give example PR for AIPowerMeme
* Update [`src/chainparams.cpp`](/src/chainparams.cpp) m_assumed_blockchain_size and m_assumed_chain_state_size with the current size plus some overhead (see [this](#how-to-calculate-m_assumed_blockchain_size-and-m_assumed_chain_state_size) for information on how to calculate them).
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` chainTxData with statistics about the transaction count and rate. Use the output of the RPC `getchaintxstats`, see
  [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12270) for an example. Reviewers can verify the results by running `getchaintxstats <window_block_count> <window_last_block_hash>` with the `window_block_count` and `window_last_block_hash` from your output.

### First time / New builders

Install Guix using one of the installation methods detailed in
[contrib/guix/INSTALL.md](/contrib/guix/INSTALL.md).

Check out the source code in the following directory hierarchy.

	cd /path/to/your/toplevel/build
	git clone https://github.com/aipowermemepay/guix.sigs.git
	git clone https://github.com/aipowermeme-detached-sigs.git
	git clone https://github.com/aipowermeme.git

### AIPowerMeme Core maintainers/release engineers, suggestion for writing release notes

Write release notes. git shortlog helps a lot, for example:

    git shortlog --no-merges v(current version, e.g. 0.12.2)..v(new version, e.g. 0.12.3)

Generate list of authors:

    git log --format='- %aN' v(current version, e.g. 0.16.0)..v(new version, e.g. 0.16.1) | sort -fiu

Tag version (or release candidate) in git

    git tag -s v(new version, e.g. 0.12.3)

### Setup and perform Guix builds

Checkout the AIPowerMeme Core version you'd like to build:

```sh
pushd ./aipowermeme
export SIGNER='(your builder key, ie UdjinM6, Pasta, etc)'
export VERSION='(new version, e.g. 20.0.0)'
git fetch "v${VERSION}"
git checkout "v${VERSION}"
popd
```

Ensure your guix.sigs are up-to-date if you wish to `guix-verify` your builds
against other `guix-attest` signatures.

```sh
git -C ./guix.sigs pull
```

### Create the macOS SDK tarball: (first time, or when SDK version changes)

Create the macOS SDK tarball, see the [macOS build
instructions](build-osx.md#deterministic-macos-dmg-notes) for
details.

### Build and attest to build outputs:

Follow the relevant Guix README.md sections:
- [Building](/contrib/guix/README.md#building)
- [Attesting to build outputs](/contrib/guix/README.md#attesting-to-build-outputs)

### Verify other builders' signatures to your own. (Optional)

Add other builders keys to your gpg keyring, and/or refresh keys: See `../aipowermeme/contrib/builder-keys/README.md`.

Follow the relevant Guix README.md sections:
- [Verifying build output attestations](/contrib/guix/README.md#verifying-build-output-attestations)

### Next steps:

Commit your signature to guix.sigs:

```sh
pushd guix.sigs
git add "${VERSION}/${SIGNER}/noncodesigned.SHA256SUMS{,.asc}"
git commit -a
git push  # Assuming you can push to the guix.sigs tree
popd
```

Codesigner only: Create Windows/macOS detached signatures:
- Only one person handles codesigning. Everyone else should skip to the next step.
- Only once the Windows/macOS builds each have 3 matching signatures may they be signed with their respective release keys.

Codesigner only: Sign the macOS binary:

    transfer aipowermeme-osx-unsigned.tar.gz to macOS for signing
    tar xf aipowermeme-osx-unsigned.tar.gz
    ./detached-sig-create.sh -s "Key ID" -o runtime
    Enter the keychain password and authorize the signature
    Move signature-osx.tar.gz back to the guix-build host

Codesigner only: Sign the windows binaries:

    tar xf aipowermeme-win-unsigned.tar.gz
    ./detached-sig-create.sh -key /path/to/codesign.key
    Enter the passphrase for the key when prompted
    signature-win.tar.gz will be created

Codesigner only: Commit the detached codesign payloads:

```sh
pushd ~/aipowermeme-detached-sigs
# checkout the appropriate branch for this release series
rm -rf *
tar xf signature-osx.tar.gz
tar xf signature-win.tar.gz
git add -A
git commit -m "point to ${VERSION}"
git tag -s "v${VERSION}" HEAD
git push the current branch and new tag
popd
```

Non-codesigners: wait for Windows/macOS detached signatures:

- Once the Windows/macOS builds each have 3 matching signatures, they will be signed with their respective release keys.
- Detached signatures will then be committed to the [aipowermeme-detached-sigs](https://github.com/aipowermeme-detached-sigs) repository, which can be combined with the unsigned apps to create signed binaries.

Create (and optionally verify) the codesigned outputs:
- [Codesigning](/contrib/guix/README.md#codesigning)

Commit your signature for the signed macOS/Windows binaries:

```sh
pushd ./guix.sigs
git add "${VERSION}/${SIGNER}"/all.SHA256SUMS{,.asc}
git commit -m "Add ${SIGNER} ${VERSION} signed binaries signatures"
git push  # Assuming you can push to the guix.sigs tree
popd
```

### After 3 or more people have guix-built and their results match:

Combine the `all.SHA256SUMS.asc` file from all signers into `SHA256SUMS.asc`:

```bash
cat "$VERSION"/*/all.SHA256SUMS.asc > SHA256SUMS.asc
```

- Upload to the aipowermeme.org server:
    1. The contents of each `./aipowermeme/guix-build-${VERSION}/output/${HOST}/` directory, except for
       `*-debug*` files.

       Guix will output all of the results into host subdirectories, but the SHA256SUMS
       file does not include these subdirectories. In order for downloads via torrent
       to verify without directory structure modification, all of the uploaded files
       need to be in the same directory as the SHA256SUMS file.

       The `*-debug*` files generated by the guix build contain debug symbols
       for troubleshooting by developers. It is assumed that anyone that is
       interested in debugging can run guix to generate the files for
       themselves. To avoid end-user confusion about which file to pick, as well
       as save storage space *do not upload these to the aipowermeme.org server*.

       ```sh
       find guix-build-${VERSION}/output/ -maxdepth 2 -type f -not -name "SHA256SUMS.part" -and -not -name "*debug*" -exec scp {} user@aipowermeme.org:/var/www/bin/aipowermeme-core-${VERSION} \;
       ```

    2. The `SHA256SUMS` file

    3. The `SHA256SUMS.asc` combined signature file you just created

- Announce the release:

  - Release on AIPowerMeme forum: https://www.aipowermeme.org/forum/topic/official-announcements.54/

  - Optionally Discord, twitter, reddit /r/AIPowerMemepay, ... but this will usually sort out itself

  - Notify flare so that he can start building [the PPAs](https://launchpad.net/~aipowermeme.org/+archive/ubuntu/aipowermeme)

  - Archive release notes for the new version to `doc/release-notes/` (branch `master` and branch of the release)

  - Create a [new GitHub release](https://github.com/aipowermeme/releases/new) with a link to the archived release notes.

  - Celebrate

### MacOS Notarization

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the latest Xcode installed on your macOS device. You can download it from the Apple Developer website.
You should have a valid Apple Developer ID under the team you are using which is necessary for the notarization process.
To avoid including your password as cleartext in a notarization script, you can provide a reference to a keychain item. You can add a new keychain item named AC_PASSWORD from the command line using the notarytool utility:
```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "AC_PASSWORD" --apple-id "AC_USERNAME" --team-id <WWDRTeamID> --password <secret_2FA_password>
```

#### Notarization
Open Terminal, and navigate to the location of the .dmg file.

Then, run the following command to notarize the .dmg file:

```
xcrun notarytool submit aipowermeme-{version}-osx.dmg --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD" --wait
```
Replace "{version}" with the version you are notarizing. This command uploads the .dmg file to Apple's notary service.

The --wait option makes the command wait to return until the notarization process is complete.

If the notarization process is successful, the notary service generates a log file URL. Please save this URL, as it contains valuable information regarding the notarization process.

#### Notarization Validation

After successfully notarizing the .dmg file, extract "AIPowerMeme-Qt.app" from the .dmg.
To verify that the notarization process was successful, run the following command:

```
spctl -a -vv -t install AIPowerMeme-Qt.app
```
Replace "AIPowerMeme-Qt.app" with the path to your .app file. This command checks whether your .app file passes Gatekeeperâ€™s
checks. If the app is successfully notarized, the command line will include a line stating source=Notarized Developer ID.

### Additional information

#### How to calculate `m_assumed_blockchain_size` and `m_assumed_chain_state_size`

Both variables are used as a guideline for how much space the user needs on their drive in total, not just strictly for the blockchain.
Note that all values should be taken from a **fully synced** node and have an overhead of 5-10% added on top of its base value.

To calculate `m_assumed_blockchain_size`:
- For `mainnet` -> Take the size of the AIPowerMeme Core data directory, excluding `/regtest` and `/testnet3` directories.
- For `testnet` -> Take the size of the `/testnet3` directory.


To calculate `m_assumed_chain_state_size`:
- For `mainnet` -> Take the size of the `/chainstate` directory.
- For `testnet` -> Take the size of the `/testnet3/chainstate` directory.

Notes:
- When taking the size for `m_assumed_blockchain_size`, there's no need to exclude the `/chainstate` directory since it's a guideline value and an overhead will be added anyway.
- The expected overhead for growth may change over time, so it may not be the same value as last release; pay attention to that when changing the variables.
